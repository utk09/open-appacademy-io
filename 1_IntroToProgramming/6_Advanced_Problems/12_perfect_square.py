"""
Write a method perfect_square_or_not that takes in a number and returns a boolean indicating whether it is a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that results from multiplying a number by itself. For example, 9 is a perfect square because 3  3 = 9, 25 is a perfect square because 5  5 = 25.
