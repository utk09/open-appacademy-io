"""
The fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers whose first and second elements are 1. To generate further elements of the sequence we take the sum of the previous two elements. For example the first 6 fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. Write a method fibonacci that takes in a number length and returns the fibonacci sequence up to the given length.
