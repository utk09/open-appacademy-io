# open-appacademy-io

This repository is a Work-In-Progress(WIP).
It contains Pythonic code for all the Ruby Examples of Intro To Programming from http://open.appacademy.io/

Codes from other folders will be added as I move forward through the course.

Let me warn you, all the code is not really modular code. I have focussed on solving the problem rather than worrying about the [Big O](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/).

Feel free to point any errors, [fork the repository](https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/intro-version-control-git/about-forks/) or make a [Pull Request](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/) to add modular code.

Lastly, I know it's not much, but it's honest work :smiley:
